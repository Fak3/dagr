### FAQ
Will I be banned from deviantArt if I use dagr.py?
Not likely. However, dagr.py could be blocked at any time. If you want to be sure your main account isn't banned, use a disposable account and a proxy.

The deviantArt page says a deviant has 145 deviations but the program can only find 139!
Sometimes deviantArt reports the wrong number of deviations in a gallery. This is because you can submit deviations exclusively to a group without having it show up in your gallery.

Why can I not download mature deviations?
You must use a deviantArt account that is able to view such deviations, and has "Show Deviations with Mature Content" enabled under Settings > Browsing.
